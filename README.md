The content of this repository is deployed to <https://szarnyasg.github.io/graph-data-management-pointers>.

This repository contains pointers to the theory and practice of modern graph data management:

* [**GQL and SQL/PGQ**](GQL-and-SQL-PGQ): the GQL (Graph Query Language) standard and the SQL/PGQ (Property Graph Queries) extension in the SQL:2023 standard both allow querying graphs using the visual syntax popularized by [Cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypher_(query_language))
* [**Relational techniques for graph processing**](Relational-Techniques-for-Graph-Processing) have been researched and experimented with for decades
* [**RDF and SPARQL**](RDF-and-SPARQL) still play a significant role
